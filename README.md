# Face_recognition_using_Raspberry_Pi
This project implements real-time face recognition on a Raspberry Pi 4B using the face_recognition and OpenCV libraries. Upon detecting an authorized face, a stepper motor (28BYJ-48) rotates 180 degrees and returns to its original position when no face is detected.
